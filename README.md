# wiki_crawler
PHP script to create a chain of linked wikipedia pages

The main class has methods to retrieve pages from wikipedia based on a search term, and to grab and return  list of outbound links from a page

TODO: the domain pneumaco.com is hardcoded in to the Curl requests - to be generally useful, this will need a config file or something.
